\chapter*{Preface}


I chose the topic of high performance computing because FPGA's are an interest of mine and it seemed challenging. Little did I know that I would be given the opportunity to study the Zynq platform, real cutting edge technology. To do this I had to acquire a lot of skills I did not previously have, and I improved a lot I did have. I learned a lot about hardware design using both VHDL and HLS tools, as well as embedded development, both for bare metal ARM and embedded Linux. The skills I have gained in creating this work will undoubtedly prove of great value in my future career as an engineer, in which I hope I can continue working on exciting systems such as the Zynq. \\

First of all I would like to thank my promotors, Dr. ir. Erik D'Hollander and Dr. An Braeken for their patience and support in guiding my work.\\

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Bruno Da Silva for going above and beyond in helping me get to the bottom of the Zynq platform and inspiring me too keep pushing further. \\

Many thanks go out to Ing. Laurent Segers, Ing. Yannick Verbelen, Ing. Serge Kubera and everyone else at the Rapptorlab for putting up with me all this time and making me feel welcome.\\

Finally I would also like to thank my partner Stefanie Kneuts and Thomas Wyseur for taking the time to proof read this text.
